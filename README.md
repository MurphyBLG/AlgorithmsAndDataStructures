## Arrays & Strings
Arrays task: A one-dimensional integer array of order N is given. Find the number of array elements greater than the average harmonic of the odd array elements.
Strings task: The original text is typed with errors: a word may have one or more spaces before the full stop (or not). Correct the text by removing the spaces before the dot (between the word and the dot).
