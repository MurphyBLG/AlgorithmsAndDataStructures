# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures (4th semester of study)

## Arrays & Strings
**Arrays task**: A one-dimensional integer array of order N is given. Find the number of array elements greater than the average harmonic of the odd array elements.

**Strings task**: The original text is typed with errors: a word may have one or more spaces before the full stop (or not). Correct the text by removing the spaces before the dot (between the word and the dot).

## List & Stack
**Singly linked list task**: The winter exam session logbook is a structure with the following fields: course, group code, student's last name, receipt date, course book number, discipline, exam grade for the discipline. Searching and sorting is done by course number, course record book number, date of admission.

**Stack task**: Find the average of the elements of the stack of real numbers. Place the stack element closest to the average on the first position. (The method of implementation was given by the teacher)

## Queue & Set
**Set task**: There is a list of toys, some of which are available in N kindergartens. Identify the toys on the list: a) which are not available in any of the kindergartens; b) which are available in each of the kindergartens. 

**Queue task**: Swap the minimum and first elements of the integer queue.

## Data hashing algorithms
1. Make a hash table containing the letters and their number of occurrences in the entered string. Output the table to the screen. Search for the entered letter in the hash table.
2. Build a hash table of the words of an arbitrary text file by setting its dimension from the screen. Print the word table on the screen. Search for the input word. Run the program for different table dimensions and compare the number of comparisons. Remove all words beginning with the specified letter, output the table.
3. The text file contains integers. Build a hash table from the numbers in the file. Search for the entered integer in the hash table. Compare the results of the number of comparisons for different data sets in the file.

## Data sorting algorithms
The shop chain is running a promotional campaign. Every other item is free. Naturally, the cashiers are instructed to "punch" the goods in such an order that the shop loses as little money as possible. According to the list of goods determine the maximum amount per receipt.

**Input data**: a natural number of goods (N < 1000) and then N natural numbers - prices of goods.

**Result**: one number is the maximum amount of the receipt.

## Data searching algorithms
1. Search in linear structures
Write a program that:

- asks the user for the size of the array and the search key;
- generates an array of random numbers;
- Returns the number of matches and their numbers.

Implement the program using the following algorithms: binary search.

2. Using trees in search tasks

Implement an ordered search tree algorithm. Find the search key and remove it from the tree.

3. Search in text

A text file contains text. Perform a direct search for a user-entered word using Bowyer and Moore algorithm.
